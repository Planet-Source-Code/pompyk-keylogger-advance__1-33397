i am student doing TY Bachelor in computer application...from cpica college, gujarat university, gujarat, india..

See the help section in it's working...

Keylogger: It is something via which u can just keep an eye on things which have been done via your keyboard i.e. noting down keystrokes....and also noting down the things which u do......




When u run this code..means make the exe and click it...
it will copy itself to the startup..u may delete it now since it is copied..

Now your keylogger is working....
TO make the keylogger visible..

type              keyloggercomplete                   quickly (via keyboard)...if u fail then try 2 or 3 or more times...............if successfull then it will become visible...

Now u can view the contents of what have been done since it is loaded...(use the corresponding buttons)....

now u can make the keylogger invisible by typing

keyloggerstart         quickly (via keyboard) ..same as before...



it is become invisible...

"or alternatively u can view the file keysom in c drive.."

use:  u can use it at your friends house or cybercafes ..or etc....to look on someone or your friends or your enemies...u can steal passwords..or see the content of their work or email contents...etc etc..

Remeber passwords will be in capital so u have to guess it...and one thing for getting yahoo and hotmail passwords try to search for the captions such as hotmail .. and yahoo..

I think this is one of the best keylogger's ever...If u want to learn about keylogger then study my code..and yes do vote for me..since it really took a bit of brain to make it....thx...
